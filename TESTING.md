# Testing

## Code Validation

For JavaScript and JSX code compliance I installed eslint as a dev dependency at the start of the project so that any warnings or errors were solved as each file was written. The configuration I used for eslint can be found in the eslintrc.json file for this project. I have also used prettier throughout to ensure formatting is compliant, the config file file for this is prettierrc. I have pushed both configuration files to GitHub for completeness, normally I would include these in gitignore. By running eslint at the end of the project, no errors or warnings remain
